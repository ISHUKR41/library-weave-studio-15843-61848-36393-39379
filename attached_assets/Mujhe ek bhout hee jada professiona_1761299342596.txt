BGMI AND FREE FIRE KA 

AND ISME BHOUT TYPE KE TOURNAMENT HOGA JAISE KI SOLO DUO AND SQAUD

And squad mai 80 rs per Team ka lagega and winning price 350 rs and runner up 250 milega and per kill 9rs 


Pubg ke andar squad mein 25 teams a sakta hai 

And duo mai 50 teams and solo mai 100 players 


And yahi free fire mein squad mein 12 team Ja sakti hai and Duo mein 24 team and solo mai 48 players 

Agar aap squire mein join karte hain to aapko 80rs  per team dena padenge Duo mein join karte Hain 40rs per team and agar aap solo join karna chahte ho to aapko 20 rs Dena padega and ismein Jo winner price rahega 350 rahega for solo duo and squad and runner up price rahega 150 RS and per kill aapko ₹5 milega 

And pictures ka bhi use karna to aur behtar rahega website ke liye


And Tum to jante Hi Ho ki yah sab karne ke liye website ke andar do sections hone chahie do nahin sorry teen section hone chahie pahla jo hai homepage second pubg and third free fire home page ke andar thoda bahut detail rahana chahie pabji kya game hai and free fire kya game hai and jab Koi pubg wala page open Karega to usmein rul regulation rahana chahie likha hua pahle Se Hi ki iska kya rul Hai क्या-क्या policy ham log de rahe hain yah sab rahega and ek form rahega form mein team leader ke name rahega like sabse pahle team name rahega FIR team leader ka naam rahega kya rahega uska naam jo bhi hai uske bad pubg ka id 3 litre ka pubg ka id team leader ke WhatsApp ka number jo ki active Rahe hamesha and player tu ka name player tu ka pubg id player 3 ka name player three ke pubg ID player 4 ka name and player for ka pubg ID yah Ho Gaya squad match ke liye 


Like pubg page per jab Koi open Karega to uske andar teen section baithe hue hone chahie first solo squad and duo
And same as a he duo ke liye bhe rahegaa idme tum khud se apna logic laga lena 

And payment karne ke liye qr code pahle Se Hi rahega to agar aap payment kar dete hain to uska screenshot aapko dalna padega and transaction ID dalna padega uske andar aur aap submit kar sakte hain 


Same aise hee free fire ke liye bhe page rahegaa similar iske jaise hee 

And ismein bhi Tum apna logic and mind use kar lena 

And your pubg pesh ke andar teen section rahega solo squad and  duo abhi ke liye to yah rahega ki lagbhag sabke andar yahi show Karega plot Van karke like agar Main solve karestation open karta hun registration form ya FIR Jo Tum Bolo usko form bol lo to mere ko stall like yah admin ke pass jaega admin approve Karega to Aisa matlab sabji mein teen sections rahega to uska FIR Excel sheet aaega free fire mein teen section rahega uska FIR excel sheet to Matlab admin ko jo hai bahut problem sahana padega usko kyunki check bhi karna padega Koi agar transaction kar raha hai to sahi se transaction hua Hai ki nahin vah matlab screenshot dekh ke hi approve Karega to admin panel bahut hi humko advance banana padega iske liye taki sab chij sahi se pata chal paye like admin panel mein bhi do section rahega ek pubg ke liye aur ek free fire ke liye aur usmein hi matlab jo bhi upload karega jo bhi upload karega screenshot V uske andar dikhna chahie ki han Jaise pahla koi team Hai team ka name hoga to uska pura team ka details player ka niyam vagaira sab chij uske andar dikhna chahie payment Jo usne Kiya vah dekhna chahie aur uske sabse last mein approve ya FIR reject ka option mere pass rahana chahie agar Main approve kar deta hun to 18 select ho gai hai aur reject kar deta hun to usmein kuchh gadbadi hai to Aisa Hi matlab iske andar bhi free fire ke andar bhi sem rahega but pubg mein bhi Aisa Hi rahega and teen stall har ek bar rahega pubg mein bhi aur free fire mein bhi 


To like main yah bol raha hun ki Jaise slot Van pubg ke andar bhi teen aur section hone chahie admin page ke andar hi aise slot 1 solo slot 1 duo and slot 1 squad 

Same free fire ke liye bhi sim logic Hi rahega 

And mujhe Apne website ke liye back and front and sab chij tumhen Banakar Dena tumko Jo matlab Lage ki han yah language best rahega is website ke liye like backend mein bhi to bahut hai language use hote Hain 

To Jo tumko Lage ki nahin yah jo hai language best rahega Jo Main website banaa raha hun uske according to Ve language to use kar lena backend ke liye and front and mein mere ko fulli professional and modern website chahie 

And main ise Abhi pure acche tarike Se to host nahin karunga but main ise vercel par diploy karunga to usmein Matlab mere ko koi error nahin aana chahie jab Main diploy karne jaaun and Mera back hand bhi front and bhi sab chij acche se kam karna chahie 


And ek aur baat Jaise matlab slot to pubg ke andar squire mein 25 hi team magistrate kar sakti hai and duo mein 50 team and solo mein 100 player 

Tum mujhe isiliye time mein hamesha update chahie like agar Main Man ke chaliye vehicle per agar koi team register Karti Hai uske bad mein aur kisi ko bhi yah link bhejta Hun to agar koi team register kar chuki hai to uska matlab yah stall dikhna chahie ki han ek stall phool ho chuka hai plot nahin sorr
Matlab yah pata lag Jana chahie Jaise agar koi squire mein game khelna chahta Hai to Main squad mein ek Team register kar chuki hai to ab bacha 25 stall mein se ek stall Khali ho gaya hai to usko 24 plot hi dikhna chahie 24 stall available hai FIR agar vah bhi register kar leti Hai to 23 slot Khali rahana chahie aise hi solo mein agar koi ek player register kar leta hai to 99 stall Khali rahana chahie matlab 99 uske andar usko seat vacant dikhne chahie stall mein बार-बार bol dena vah galti Hai Mera but tum samajh jao apna logic use kar lena 


And same logic free fire ke liye bhi rahega

And your pubg pesh ke andar teen section rahega solo squad and  duo abhi ke liye to yah rahega ki lagbhag sabke andar yahi show Karega plot Van karke like agar Main solve karestation open karta hun registration form ya FIR Jo Tum Bolo usko form bol lo to mere ko stall like yah admin ke pass jaega admin approve Karega to Aisa matlab sabji mein teen sections rahega to uska FIR Excel sheet aaega free fire mein teen section rahega uska FIR excel sheet to Matlab admin ko jo hai bahut problem sahana padega usko kyunki check bhi karna padega Koi agar transaction kar raha hai to sahi se transaction hua Hai ki nahin vah matlab screenshot dekh ke hi approve Karega to admin panel bahut hi humko advance banana padega iske liye taki sab chij sahi se pata chal paye like admin panel mein bhi do section rahega ek pubg ke liye aur ek free fire ke liye aur usmein hi matlab jo bhi upload karega jo bhi upload karega screenshot V uske andar dikhna chahie ki han Jaise pahla koi team Hai team ka name hoga to uska pura team ka details player ka niyam vagaira sab chij uske andar dikhna chahie payment Jo usne Kiya vah dekhna chahie aur uske sabse last mein approve ya FIR reject ka option mere pass rahana chahie agar Main approve kar deta hun to 18 select ho gai hai aur reject kar deta hun to usmein kuchh gadbadi hai to Aisa Hi matlab iske andar bhi free fire ke andar bhi sem rahega but pubg mein bhi Aisa Hi rahega and teen stall har ek bar rahega pubg mein bhi aur free fire mein bhi 


To like main yah bol raha hun ki Jaise slot Van pubg ke andar bhi teen aur section hone chahie admin page ke andar hi aise slot 1 solo slot 1 duo and slot 1 squad 

Same free fire ke liye bhi sim logic Hi rahega 

And mujhe Apne website ke liye back and front and sab chij tumhen Banakar Dena tumko Jo matlab Lage ki han yah language best rahega is website ke liye like backend mein bhi to bahut hai language use hote Hain 

To Jo tumko Lage ki nahin yah jo hai language best rahega Jo Main website banaa raha hun uske according to Ve language to use kar lena backend ke liye and front and mein mere ko fulli professional and modern website chahie 

And main ise Abhi pure acche tarike Se to host nahin karunga but main ise vercel par diploy karunga to usmein Matlab mere ko koi error nahin aana chahie jab Main diploy karne jaaun and Mera back hand bhi front and bhi sab chij acche se kam karna chahie 


And ek aur baat Jaise matlab slot to pubg ke andar squire mein 25 hi team magistrate kar sakti hai and duo mein 50 team and solo mein 100 player 

Tum mujhe isiliye time mein hamesha update chahie like agar Main Man ke chaliye vehicle per agar koi team register Karti Hai uske bad mein aur kisi ko bhi yah link bhejta Hun to agar koi team register kar chuki hai to uska matlab yah stall dikhna chahie ki han ek stall phool ho chuka hai plot nahin sorr
Matlab yah pata lag Jana chahie Jaise agar koi squire mein game khelna chahta Hai to Main squad mein ek Team register kar chuki hai to ab bacha 25 stall mein se ek stall Khali ho gaya hai to usko 24 plot hi dikhna chahie 24 stall available hai FIR agar vah bhi register kar leti Hai to 23 slot Khali rahana chahie aise hi solo mein agar koi ek player register kar leta hai to 99 stall Khali rahana chahie matlab 99 uske andar usko seat vacant dikhne chahie stall mein बार-बार bol dena vah galti Hai Mera but tum samajh jao apna logic use kar lena 


And same logic free fire ke liye bhi rahega
